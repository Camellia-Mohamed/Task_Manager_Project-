# Task Manager 

1. Task Creation and Management: Allow users to create tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, priorities, and categories. Enable them to edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.

2. Reminders and Notifications: Implement a reminder system that sends notifications to users for upcoming tasks and deadlines. Users should have the ability to customize the timing and frequency of reminders.

3. Task Prioritization: Allow users to assign priorities to their tasks, such as high, medium, or low. Implement sorting and filtering options to view tasks based on priority levels.

4. Task Dependencies: Enable users to link tasks together and define dependencies. This feature ensures that certain tasks cannot be started until their dependent tasks are completed.

5. Task Assignment and Collaboration: Provide the ability to assign tasks to specific individuals or teams. Implement features that facilitate collaboration, such as task comments, file attachments, and real-time updates.

6. Recurring Tasks: Allow users to create tasks that repeat at specific intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or custom recurrence patterns. This feature is useful for tasks that occur regularly, such as paying bills or scheduling meetings.

7. Tags and Labels: Implement a system for users to categorize and label tasks using tags or labels. This allows for easy organization and filtering of tasks based on specific criteria.

8. Task Notes and Attachments: Enable users to add additional notes or descriptions to tasks. Allow attachments of files or links related to the task, such as documents or web resources.

9. Progress Tracking: Provide users with the ability to track the progress of their tasks. This can be done through status updates, progress percentages, or visual indicators, giving users a clear view of their task completion.

10. Data Export: Allow users to export their task data in various formats, such as CSV or PDF.
